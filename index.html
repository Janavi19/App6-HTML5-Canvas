//FIXED. Canvas element would go first and then functions would follow to correspond with button work.
var docMod = document.lastModified; // loads last modified time stamp into docMod variable
alert("This file last modified " + docMod); // generates alert box with time stamp. If annoying, comment out this entire line.
console.log("This file last modified " + docMod); // generates message in javaScript console (found in developers tools) with time stamp. 

var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
// This variable is retrieves the connection between function and the canvas element in the body.
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");	
// This variable is the reason that things are being displayed. The 2d string is a must for the context variable so that fillStyle, fillRect, etc. will generate.
